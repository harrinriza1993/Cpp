# CLASS AND OBJECTS

### CLASS :

A class definition starts wClass is a blueprint for creating objects, providing initial values for state(member variables or attributes) and implementations of behaviour(member functions or methods).ith the keyword class followed by the class name; and the class body, enclosed by a pair of curly braces. A class definition must be followed either by a semicolon or a list of declarations.

```bash
Syntax :
		class classname
		{
			attributes;
			methods;
		};
```

# OBJECTS :
An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated. A class provides the blueprints for objects, so basically an object is created from a class.

```bash
Declaration :
		classname object1;
		classname object2;
```
